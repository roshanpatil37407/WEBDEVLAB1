    <h1 id="lik">Linkdin </h1>
    <p>A lot of people think that publishing content somewhere other than their own
      blog would not really be beneficial, because they would be driving traffic
      to some other website. That is why many bloggers choose to stick to their
      blogs and not post content elsewhere, except when they engage in guest blogging.
      However, blogging on LinkedIn can actually drive more readers to your blog.
      According to the latest LinkedIn statistics, LinkedIn has more than 500 million
      users, 250 million of which are active on the platform on a monthly basis.
      These numbers speak volumes about the exposure and reach that you could have
      if you were to put your efforts into blogging on LinkedIn.

    <h1 id="git">Github </h1>

      and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control
